\description{
Run limma contrasts with optional probe replicates
}
\details{
This function is called by \code{se_contrast_stats()} to perform
the comparisons defined as contrasts. The \code{se_contrast_stats()}
function operates on a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object,
this function operates on the \code{numeric} \code{matrix} values
directly.

This function also calls \code{ebayes2dfs()} which extracts
each contrast result as a \code{data.frame}, whose column names
are modified to include the contrast names.

This function optionally (not yet ported from previous
implementation) detects replicate probes, and performs
the internal correlation calculations recommended by
\verb{limma user guide} for replicate probes. In that case,
it detects each level of probe replication so that
each can be properly calculated. For example, Agilent
human 4x44 arrays often contain a large number of probes
with 8 replicates; a subset of probes with 4 replicates;
then the remaining probes (the majority overall) have
only one replicate each. In that case, this function
splits data into 8-replicate, 4-replicate, and 1-replicate
subsets, calculates correlations on the 8-replicate and
4-replicate subsets separately, then runs limma calculations
on the three subsets independently, then merges the results
into one large table. The end result is that the
final table contains one row per unique probe after
adjusting for probe replication properly in each scenario.
As the Agilent microarray layout is markedly less widely
used that in past, the priority to port this methodology
is quite low.
